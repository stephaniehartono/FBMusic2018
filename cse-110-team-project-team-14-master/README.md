# Flashback Music

## Introduction
Flashback Music is an Android app that adaptively selects music to play based on your location and time of day to help bring back memories of past times.  Like any music player, you can select tracks or albums to play.  When Flashback Music is put into flashback mode, it automatically selects tracks to remind you of past times:  If you played a track at a place, you're more likely to hear that track when you return to that place again.  The same goes for time-of-day and day of the week.  Whether you're in flashback mode or not, the player displays the date, time, and place when the track was last played.  You can indicate a track is a favorite by clicking the + button next to the track, which will turn into a check mark and increase the chance of the track being played in flashback mode.  More recently played tracks are more likely to be played in flashback mode, but even the least-recently-played track has a chance of being played again.  If you don't want to hear a track again, clicking the + twice (or the check mark once) will indicate dislike, and an "x" will be displayed in place of the + or checkmark that was previously displayed.  Such a track will not be played in flashback mode, nor when an album containing the track is played.  Clicking the "x" returns the track's status to the neutral +.
